Magazin ALPIN is an online store for the sale of special hiking equipment. Through it, I managed to create a backend that would capture the communication of the site with the database. The store has the following specific functionalities: connecting and creating a user account where I managed to implement a security measure for hiding the user's password using the php password_hash ( ) function; viewing the list of products, adding them to the cart, choosing or adding a delivery address, placing orders and viewing a history of orders made for the customer. Admin has the right to perform CRUD operations for the product list. All these things being possible using the sessions. We also used internationalization and thus, with the help of two buttons we can choose the language of displaying the content of the store, respectively the Romanian or English language.
